# Bootstrap Starter

This is a boilerplate for a bootstrap template.

### Prerequisites

Tested with Node 18.16.0 and NPM 9.5.1

### Building

```bash
npm run dev
```

Will compile scss and js with sourcemaps and copy from "src" to "dist." demo.html example to make sure things look right.

```bash
npm run start
```

Will launch browsersync and watch changes in scss and js in the "src" dirctory, and html files in the root directory.

```bash
npm run build
```
